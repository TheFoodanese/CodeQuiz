# Web APIs - Code Quiz
## Description
As you progress in your journey to becoming a front-end web developer, you may encounter coding assessments as part of job interviews or bootcamp evaluations. These assessments typically involve multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

To help you prepare for these tests and apply the skills learned in this module, this challenge tasks you with building a timed coding quiz. This quiz will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. Your goal is to create a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## User Story
As a coding boot camp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.
